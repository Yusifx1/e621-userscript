# e621-userscript
Downloader and scrapper for e621 pools, sets and posts(tags). JavaScript (userscript) version of my bash script.

# To-Do

+ Add scraper to all page

# Future Plans
I am tired from moving to JavaScript and understanded that HTML coding need to. When I thinked that it will be my final code I saw that when downloading same pool firefox duplicate them. I will add post skip. No matter that I can use bash in termux but now I want create app for Android (if I can Windows to). It will take more time than this project and Android studio not work fine in my pc and can't create .apk from gradle. It will be great disappointment if android won't block duplicate download or give read access.
